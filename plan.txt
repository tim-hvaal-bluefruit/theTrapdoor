FIX-UP
New idea - drop item could solve a puzzle. zelda like puzzle, you need to remember the state of a room in order to proceed
add parlour items, crowbar, large knife, skull
open doesn't work - don't bother?


NOTE - google error codes when you see them - this is part of Python learning

DONE
examine working properly
Add feature to examine room by room name
Bug with key text - now every item has an inventory description instead
Add an examine function ... always available. loop through -> room items, room interactive, inv - (display if available)
What is pycache? Can i hide it from git?
Use key without key doesn't print any text
Setup debug to run by hitting button from anywhere
Add github repo - commit everything so far



crowbar trapdoor, sets counter 7 moves.
check timer - when 7 monster comes and knocks you out - game over
close trapdoor, checks timer, if 7 hits monster on head, you win
final easter egg, guess characters name, if Burk you get pic and sound playing
package up into final playable package
now i've made this, i can make something quite a lot better! but can i be bothered? yeah map it out!
pygame shell!

Everything now is much more straightforward!

why can't i change the room easily? remember i was trying to set a variable to equal a string instead of a dict
  KeyError: means you're trying to access an item that doesn't exist

######################
# CTRL SHFT H vs CTRL H - how to do this in CLion, looks like it looks from the project base, can you specify a subfolder
# bug to fix - picking up items need to change their description
# can't debug because of circular import problem - how to fix
# circular imports problem - dont import main module into others etc
# solved problem of dics containing references to other dicts - has to be set when the item is got
# or could be set with an init method - better

use sleep to build suspense
truth tables?
Part 2...
  key to open another door, human skull in there, table with blood on it and a large spider scuttling around, get spider, get skull, get knife, can't do anything further
  check trapdoor every loop
  if open count to five. If shut, reset the count
  trapdoor function runs each loop, player msg depending on the count
  if monster comes out you get eaten
  if you close the trapdoor on count of five you hit the monster on the head and win
  winning message. You closed the door just in time just a huge slimy creature was coming up through the door. The weight of the door must have crushed the monsters head,
  you hear a loud thud a few seconds later as the beast hit the floor some way below. 
  You've won the game, but always remember - stay away from that trapdoor... cuz there's something down there
  Easter egg... what's your name - if answer = Burk print end_screen.

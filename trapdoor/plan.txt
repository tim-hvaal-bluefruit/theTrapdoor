FIX-UP
New idea - drop item could solve a puzzle. zelda like puzzle, you need to remember the state of a room in order to proceed
add parlour items, crowbar, large knife, skull
open doesn't work - don't bother?


NOTE - google error codes when you see them - this is part of Python learning

DONE
examine working properly
Add feature to examine room by room name
Bug with key text - now every item has an inventory description instead
Add an examine function ... always available. loop through -> room items, room interactive, inv - (display if available)
What is pycache? Can i hide it from git?
Use key without key doesn't print any text
Setup debug to run by hitting button from anywhere
Add github repo - commit everything so far



crowbar trapdoor, sets counter 7 moves.
check timer - when 7 monster comes and knocks you out - game over
close trapdoor, checks timer, if 7 hits monster on head, you win
final easter egg, guess characters name, if Burk you get pic and sound playing
package up into final playable package
now i've made this, i can make something quite a lot better! but can i be bothered? yeah map it out!
pygame shell!

Everything now is much more straightforward!

why can't i change the room easily? remember i was trying to set a variable to equal a string instead of a dict
  KeyError: means you're trying to access an item that doesn't exist

# CTRL SHFT H vs CTRL H - how to do this in CLion, looks like it looks from the project base, can you specify a subfolder
# bug to fix - picking up items need to change their description
# can't debug because of circular import problem - how to fix
# circular imports problem - dont import main module into others etc
# solved problem of dics containing references to other dicts - has to be set when the item is got
# or could be set with an init method - better

plan of action

DONE  setup debug to run by hitting button from anywhere. 
TODO  examine. always available. loop through -> room items, room interactive, inv - (display if available)
TODO  google error codes as they come up - make notes
TODO  bug - item descriptions need there own one if in inventory
TODO  parlour items - crowbar, large knife, skull
TODO  crowbar trapdoor, sets counter 7 moves.
TODO  check timer - when 7 monster comes and knocks you out - game over
TODO  close trapdoor, checks timer, if 7 hits monster on head, you win
TODO  final easter egg, guess characters name, if Burk you get pic and sound playing
TODO  package up into final playable package
TODO  now i've made this, i can make something quite a lot better! but can i be bothered? yeah map it out!
TODO  pygame shell!

Everything now is much more straightforward!

why can't i change the room easily? remember i was trying to set a variable to equal a string instead of a dict
  KeyError: means you're trying to access an item that doesn't exist

Fix
What is pycache? Can i hide it from git?
Add an examine function ... always available. loop through -> room items, room interactive, inv - (display if available)
standardise text for every object, location and interactable
amend inventory function to check for inventory description if it's in there
add parlour items, crowbar, large knife, skull


NOTE - google error codes when you see them - this is part of Python learning

DONE
Use key without key doesn't print any text
Setup debug to run by hitting button from anywhere
Add github repo - commit everything so far



crowbar trapdoor, sets counter 7 moves.
check timer - when 7 monster comes and knocks you out - game over
close trapdoor, checks timer, if 7 hits monster on head, you win
final easter egg, guess characters name, if Burk you get pic and sound playing
package up into final playable package
now i've made this, i can make something quite a lot better! but can i be bothered? yeah map it out!
pygame shell!

Everything now is much more straightforward!

why can't i change the room easily? remember i was trying to set a variable to equal a string instead of a dict
  KeyError: means you're trying to access an item that doesn't exist
